## Introduction

Hello outsider,

This **"Funda Buurtchecker"** show the most relevant house suggestions based on your personal preferences.

## Research

People looking for a house mostly spend alot of time on the funda.nl websites setting all the filters right, which is a good thing. But by talking to some close friends I found out that sometimes they just want to do a quick check to get some inspiration instead of going to the computer and fill out all the filters.

## Use Case
On the funda.nl site most people feel forced to give a price range but price isn't always the most important factor. For example; somebody wants a garage but their isn't a nice house in their exact price range they filled in. They are happy to maybe say 10.000 extra to get that garage but it won't show up in the filter results.
